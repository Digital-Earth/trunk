License Server PyxNet Configuration
===================================

Each instance of LicenseServer must have a unique Primary and Secondary PyxNetLicenseService (PyxNet PrivateKey, NodeId, and ServiceInstance).
The utility function CreateSerializedLicenseService() in PyxNetConfig.cs can be used to generate the Settings needed.
