    <h2 class="title" style="border-bottom: none; padding-bottom: 0;">Where geography education has never gone before</h2>
   
    <p>OTTAWA, April 15, 2015 – Primary students are already calling the program "cool" and "super easy" and on April 16, teachers, geographers and members of the geomatics sector will have a chance to see for themselves what the revolutionary 3-D <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Earth">Digital Earth</a> platform is all about.</p>

    <p>Professor Lynn Moorman is set to launch her GeoLiteracy Project using <a href="http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/educational_products/">Canadian Geographic Education</a> (CGEd) <a href="https://www.worldview.gallery/Gallery/8e6df483-9438-48ec-8f64-536f9adaba56">geospatial data sets</a> and the PYXIS Innovation&#8482; WorldView&#8482; Studio. The project empowers students to search, combine, analyze and share the Earth’s information on demand. On Thursday at <a href="http://mtroyal.ca/AboutMountRoyal/MediaRoom/Newsroom/moormangis.htm">Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta</a>, savvy Grade 5 students from Calgary’s <a href="http://www.connectcharter.ca/wordpress/">Connect Charter School</a> will play teachers in demonstrating WorldView&#8482; Studio and how this software platform allows them to search and find answers to their geography questions. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWEPL0Qodgo&list=PLhi3gHiey51ChUTv7KvGJvBN3JQTY_pbN&index=2">here</a> to see early student feedback.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.gogeomatics.ca/magazine/finding-the-way-with-geoliteracy.htm">The GeoLiteracy Project</a> is a prime example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics">geomatics</a>, or the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, one of the fasting growing sectors of the information-based economy. Why is Moorman’s project important? For the first time there is a centralized online search platform (<a href="https://www.worldview.gallery/">www.WorldView.gallery</a>) whereby decision-makers can search geospatial data on a global scale. Not only that, WorldView&#8482; Studio empowers anyone to search, integrate and analyze data in a Digital Earth platform.</p>

    <p>Canada’s geomatics industry is comprised of approximately 2500 firms across the country, with annual revenues of nearly $2.5 Billion. Alberta, Canada’s geomatics epicenter, has over 600 geomatics companies generating more than $1 Billion in revenue each year.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.rcgs.org/about/history/gilles-gagnier-publisher.asp">Gilles Gagnier</a>, Chief Operating Officer and Publisher of <a href="http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/">Canadian Geographic</a> Enterprises, is thrilled that Canadian Geographic maps can now be viewed within a 3D Digital Earth environment. In his <a href="https://youtu.be/U4qZhtwcP8Y">video message</a>, he anticipates the day when Canadian Geographic Education can deliver the GeoLiteracy Project to its 14,000 teacher members across Canada.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.tecterra.com/">TECTERRA</a>, a Calgary-based, non-profit organization that supports geomatics solutions, contributed $200,000 to the project. In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJec0CVdtrE&list=PLhi3gHiey51ChUTv7KvGJvBN3JQTY_pbN&index=2">video message</a>, <a href="http://www.tecterra.com/management-team.html">Dr. Mohamed Abousalem</a>, Chief Executive Officer of TECTERRA, says geomatics can get students excited about geography and help Canada maintain its competitive advantage. While Canada is a world leader in geomatics, the U.S. government will soon be investing billions of dollars in geospatial education to equip their students with 21st century skills.</p>

    <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGU6k4OIZwo&index=1&list=PLhi3gHiey51ChUTv7KvGJvBN3JQTY_pbN">his video message</a>, <a href="http://www.pyxisinnovation.com/">PYXIS</a> CEO Perry Peterson says students need to get comfortable now with the emerging new Digital Earth technologies. As its contribution, the PYXIS Innovation&#8482; brought their cutting-edge technology and worked with Moorman to create a child-friendly <a href="https://www.worldview.gallery/signUp">WorldView&#8482; Studio</a>, allowing students to explore and learn about their world more easily.</p>

    <p>The project was conceived and led by <a href="http://www.mtroyal.ca/ProgramsCourses/FacultiesSchoolsCentres/ScienceTechnology/Departments/EarthSciences/Faculty/ES_Bio_LMoorm">Dr. Lynn Moorman</a>, a Mount Royal professor who applied for the funding and brought the partners together. "Children are naturally curious about the world around them," she says. "WorldView&#8482; Studio is a playground to excite and empower students to learn more about geography, to think spatially and to engage with Digital Earth." For her important contribution to the field of geography education, Dr. Moorman was named the <a href="http://www.ncge.org/2015-award-winners">2015 recipient</a> of the prestigious <a href="http://www.ncge.org/natoli-dissertation-award">Salvatore J. Natoli Award from the National Council for Geographic Education</a>. She will receive her award in Washington, D.C. in August 2015.
