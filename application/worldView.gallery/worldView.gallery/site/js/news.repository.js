We believe in the powerful wisdom that decision-makers can evoke when they have ready access to observe the Earth and its many systems.  I want it to be very easy for decision-makers to get at and use that information. You should not have to be an expert in geographic information systems.  Digital-Earth will involve all of us; from emergencies to education, fisheries to farming, resources to recreation.

When land owners and stakeholders have a common view of the land assets, we are all working together to make better decisions\”, says Perry Peterson. </p><p> The World Bank states: \“Although they are by no means a silver bullet, recent innovations in geospatial technologies provide exciting opportunities to document and analyze determinants, as well as impacts of land use change that are of great relevance for policy, projects, and research in this area.\” </p><p><a class=\"subtle\" \" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pyxisinnovation.com/\">The PYXIS innovation&trade;</a> is a recognized world leader in the use of discrete global grid technologies, a powerful Digital Earth reference.
