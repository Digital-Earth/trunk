- Use indexed geometry with triangle (or quad strips)
- Try to use the same texture indexes for each tile (with different image)
- Use NuVu to get a list of coords for one tile, then hard code a single Nava tile and render it
- Can load texture from a file if necessary
- Then get sockets working to drive Nerve independently
- BranchGroup for tileset (can be compiled)
- SharedGroup and Links for sharing
- Use different indices to do the full texture mapping, and also to show tiles or hexes (grid)
- Page 200 -> Texture, Texture2D, TextureAttributes, TexCoordGeneration
- Use raster geometry for labels, screen messages, etc. with Billboard behaviour
- Try reusing tiles by calling setGeometry on the Shape3D (with WRITE enabled)

Enhancements:
- png seems to be smaller in file size
- support additional data sources
- allow for binary or text protocol
- have server suggest tile vertex ordering
- consider tiling at +7 as well as +5
