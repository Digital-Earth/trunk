		<div class="title">The WorldView&#8482; Difference: A Digital Marketplace</div>
	</div>
	<div class="text clear">
		<div class="description">
			The world has changed.  Even though decision-makers are empowered with tools, information, and choices, they must still rely on others to build their maps where rich geospatial information is locked up. Organizations that create the content used to make these maps rely on inefficient methods to distribute their assets to the intermediary map making analysts.  The advantage of WorldView&#8482; is that accessing and using information no longer requires the assistance of an analyst.  You build a digital marketplace that streams content directly to end-users who create their own maps on-the-fly.

The WorldView Channel provides a common interface for end-users to discover and uses your organizations content even across a multitude of internal deployments.  It’s user friendly.

			Web applications that organize content can be cool.  Your organization will use web widgets to customize your WorldView&#8482; Channel. Expose and promote content with a custom location-based search engine; group search content based on themes and statistics like most popular, newest data, or special deals; allow free form search on tags, metadata, and content attribution; and generate word clouds.  Add attractive banners, advertisement, how to videos, and messaging to your Channel.

			Securing the access and use of your assets is vital.  You have full control over security with a range of deployment options: a firewall client server intranet, fully cloud-based service, and even a peer-to-peer network.  WorldView&#8482; can handle Big Data analysis without putting stress on your servers as the end-user does analysis locally.  You do not have to distribute your raw data as the data stream encodes and encrypts the information in a secure GeoPacket eliminating the need to download raw data to the local client.

		<div class="description">
			There is a world full of data out there: You do not need to build it all. Set your Channel to search over the entire WorldView&#8482; Platform. Often content providers are faced with the dilemma that their important geospatial data is of little value without the context of other data sources.  This leads an organization to choose a limited business model that delivers content to GIS intermediaries or to incur the expense of building and maintaining map products and applications that feature their data.  Decision-makers combine their own maps and applications: individual sources of content are fully valued.  This is a new community that is building a geospatial web we call Digital Earth.
