They are experts who demand choices and control over their own experience. They expect all the information without delay.

			Publishing big, dynamic, geospatially referenced data in a useful way can be onerous.  The WorldView&#8482; advantage is that you can drag and drop your source data into the WorldView&#8482; Studio; combine and customize it as you like; then publish as a map card. Your data is now available, in your branded WorldView&#8482; Gallery, to billions of people searching the Web.  Delivery is fast and ready-to-use in streams of intelligent and secure GeoPackets&#8482;.

You define the terms of use and the transaction model that works for you and your customers.  Your brand and license remain connected to the data wherever it is shared within the WorldView&#8482; Platform.

			Maintain control over your important data assets.  Set content discovery to public or private; secure user access with password protection; and confine access to specific spatial extents and resolutions. In wiki type mode, allow people to Add, Modify, or Delete content in collaboration with others.  Delivery of raw GIS data is a choice rather than a requirement.  Digital Rights Management is a key feature.
