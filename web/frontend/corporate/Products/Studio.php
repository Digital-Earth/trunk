			Digital Earth is all about asking questions: “Where is it?” and “What is here?”  It helps to communicate complex ideas more clearly and support informed and evidence-based decision-making.  However, geospatial data requires the context of other geospatial data to be of value.  For example, the locations of protected parklands are of much more value if combined with roads, rivers, schools, elevations, and land use.  Combining and fusing data sources into a single product is a very very hard problem.
