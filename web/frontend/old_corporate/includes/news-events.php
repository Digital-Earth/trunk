		<p>June 10 - PYXIS would like to congratuate Dr. Faramarz Samavati on his recipt of the 2013 <a target="http://grand-nce.ca/newsandmedia/news-container/2013/three-grand-researchers-2013-digital-alberta-award-winners">Digital Alberta Award for hi</a>s work in graphic modelling.<p>
		<p>January 15 - PYXIS is pleased to announce the launch of a new project: GeoWeb StreamServer on the Cloud.  This service will provide geospatial content providers with an effective, secure, and robust means to publish data to a wide variety of customers.<p>		
		<h2>2012<h2>
		<p>	Aug 1 - PYXIS is pleased to announce the completion of its Geospatial Feature Exploitation Project.  The multi-year project was generously funded through Defence Research and Development Canada and Industry Canada's Industrial Research Assistance Program.  The successful project provides the prototype for highly efficient encoding of vector, raster, and terrain data sufficient for scalable, on-line fast, data streaming, fusion and spatial analysis.  Recent proficiency tests demonstrated geopackets containing over 11 million features streamed and used over the PYXnet P2P network. The new technology is expected to be integrated into the next release of the WorldView GeoWeb Browser.</p>
		<p> May 14 - PYXIS is pleased to announce its selection to provide further support within Open Geospatial Consortium Open Web Services test bed.  PYXIS participation is supported by the Army Geospatial Center of the US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Federal Aviation Administration, Natural Resources Canada, US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the US Geological Survey.  PYXIS will be featured under the Cross-Community Interoperability Thread and we will demonstrate interoperable conflation, provenance, OWS context, volunteer geospatial information integration, and single source gazetteer services.</p>
